This section holds all of the files that are used for the front end portion of Avior. This portion was written using Sails.js. The major parts consist of Controllers, Adapters, and Models. These three pieces contribute to pulling the data from the back end (Backbone) and presenting them on the front end. The other pieces in this section for the most part are unchanged from the initial download of the sails package.
