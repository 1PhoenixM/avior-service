This section holds all of the files that are used for the back end portion of Avior. This portion was written using Sails.js. The major parts consist of Controllers, Adapters, and Models. These three pieces contribute to pulling the data from the controllers, Floodlight or Opendaylight and outputting JSON. The other pieces in this section for the most part are unchanged from the initial download of the sails package.
