This is the location of the Web interface files and the Backbone.js files. This also holds all of the views for the front end, this is the case because the sails front end only allows use to use the REST api of avior and sends the normalized data back here to be shown in the views. This folder also holds all of the major JavaScript used to pull the data from the REST api's of the controllers.
