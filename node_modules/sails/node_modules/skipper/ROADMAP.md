## Roadmap




<!--
Note for contributors:

====================================================
*** Owner (column) ***
====================================================
Your github handle and a link to your github profile (this helps us keep track of who suggested what).  The core committers may need to ask you for more details, and we'll want to try our best to keep you informed when relevant stuff changes, or if other interested contributors from the community start work on the requested feature and need help)

For example:
[@particlebanana](https://github.com/particlebanana)

or:
[@mikermcneil](https://github.com/mikermcneil)


====================================================
*** Feature (column) ***
====================================================
The topic -- a short summary of what this feature or change is all about.

• (<=8 words please)

• Features can be very specific (e.g. suggesting a new method) or quite broad (e.g. proposing an optimization or new configuration option)  However, backlog items _should always_ be more than "what if?" questions.  They should suggest an at-least-somewhat-thought-through strategy for implementing the feature.

• It's usually easier/shorter/more expressive to write these feature topics as imperative "commands". e.g. `Emit log events instead of configurable logger` is easier to read than `Can we get rid of the log and instead emit events on Waterline?`  There's plenty of space in in the "Details" section to be more eloquent, explain the "why", and so forth. So don't be afraid to sound rude here; we won't be offended :)

• Finally, there's no need to clarify that these topics are related to Waterline.  Obviously, everything in this repo is related to Waterline, right?

For example:
Add `.unpopulate()` method

or:
Support "populate..until"

or:
Support nested config via env variables

====================================================
*** Details (column) ***
====================================================

A more comprehensive description of the feature (but still relatively concise please.)

Try to answer the question: "Given how it currently works, how _should_ it work?"

• <1 paragraph (it has to fit in a table cell)

• If you need to provide more context/examples (which is likely in many cases), please do so using link(s).  If it's a one-off example or more in-depth examination, linking to a gist is usually ideal.

• If you also sent tests in your PR, please include a link to them here.

• Finally, there's no need to mention this module in your description- it should be obvious since everything in this repo is related to this module :)

e.g.
We could support nested config via env variables by using `__` to represent the `.` (has to be double underscore, single underscore prbly breaks things).  For example: `MYAPP__GENERATOR__OPTIONS__ENGINE` would turn into `generator.options.engine`. (see [tests](https://github.com/mikermcneil/rc/blob/master/test/nested-env-vars.js#L6))



======= misc =======
• Don't worry about spacing too much below-- it'll work regardless.  Just make sure the first two columns are spaced appropriately, since it makes it easier for all of us to see what's going on in here when we're editing this file.  In general, please just look at how other people are doing it and match the conventions.

• If anyone knows how to make the links to github user profiles more concise in markdown, please let me know-- it'd be a lot easier to work w/ this if we could make that first column more narrow

Thanks!

Our short-to-medium-term roadmap items, in order of descending priority:

_(feel free to suggest things)_

 Feature                                                  | Owner                                                                            | Details     
 :------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------
 proper garbage-collection support in core                | [@mikermcneil](https://github.com/mikermcneil)                                   | garbage-collect failed file uploads using the adapter's rm() method (if one exists- otherwise emit a warning)
 expose `write` method                | [@mikermcneil](https://github.com/mikermcneil)                                   | replace `receive()` with `write()` in order to simplify adapter development.  This will also make a lot of the other stuff on the list below easier, particularly progress events.
 normalized upload progress events in core                | [@mikermcneil](https://github.com/mikermcneil)                                   | remove the progress stream stuff from skipper-disk and include it in core (pipe to it, like the renamer pump)
 support for maxBytes quota enforcement in core           | [_want to help?_](https://github.com/balderdashy/skipper/edit/master/ROADMAP.md) | on-the-fly maxBytes enforcement on a per-upstream basis
 more documentation for adapter implementors                |                                    | document the method signatures/expected results/etc. for the adapter methods, from an implementation perspective
 usage documentation for ls(), rm(), read()           |                                    | document the method signatures/expected results/etc. for these methods in userland
 expose a static Upstream factory on the skipper module   | [_want to help?_](https://github.com/balderdashy/skipper/edit/master/ROADMAP.md) | useful for streaming from one fsadapter to another (i.e. not just for file uploads)
 expose a static Downstream factory on the skipper module | [_want to help?_](https://github.com/balderdashy/skipper/edit/master/ROADMAP.md) | useful for multi-file download from fsadapters
 expose an API for building Downstream reducer pumps      | [_want to help?_](https://github.com/balderdashy/skipper/edit/master/ROADMAP.md) | i.e. so you can coalesce a multi-file download into a zip archive


#### Backlog

The backlog consists of features which are not currently in the immediate-term roadmap above, but are useful.  We would exuberantly accept a pull request implementing any of the items below, so long as it was accompanied with reasonable tests that prove it, and it doesn't break other core functionality.

 Feature                                         | Owner                                                                            | Details     
 :---------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------
 streaming compression (zlib)                    | [_want to help?_](https://github.com/balderdashy/skipper/edit/master/ROADMAP.md) | transport stream to compress file uploads on their way to the remote filesystem, and decomopress them on the way out
 streaming encryption (crypto)                   | [_want to help?_](https://github.com/balderdashy/skipper/edit/master/ROADMAP.md) | transport stream to encrypt file uploads on their way to the remote filesystem, and decrypt them on the way out
 streaming thumbnail support for image uploads   | [_want to help?_](https://github.com/balderdashy/skipper/edit/master/ROADMAP.md) | transport stream to create thumbnails from streaming files on the fly, then also persist those thumbails to the remote filesystem.  Returned metadata needs to provide file descriptors (`fd`s) for each thumbnail.



#### Feature Requests

We welcome feature requests as pull requests editing the "Backlog" section above.

Before adding a new item to the backlog or the immediate roadmap, please ensure the feature you're interested in is not already covered by another row in either table.  In addition to _new_ feature requests, please feel welcome to submit any suggested edits to feature requests or roadmap items.

BTW- the most helpful feature requests also include a test which fails in the current implementation, and would pass if the requested feature was implemented :)

Thanks!
