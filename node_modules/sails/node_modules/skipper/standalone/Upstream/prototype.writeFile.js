  // Set up error handler for the new __filestream:
  //
  __filestream.once('error', function(err) {

    // If the __filestream is not being consumed (i.e. this Upstream is not
    // `connected` to anything), then we shouldn't allow errors on it to
    // go unhandled (since it would throw, causing the server to crash).

    // On the other hand, if this Upstream is already hooked up to one or more
    // receivers, we're counting on them to listen for "READ" errors on each incoming
    // file stream and handle them accordingly.
    // (i.e. cancel the write and garbage collect the already-written bytes)

    // So basically, in both cases, we'll sort of just catch the file
    // READ error and... well, do nothing.
    //
    // (keep in mind-- an error event will still be emitted on the actual
    // Upstream itself, but that's happening elsewhere.)


    // Pump any remaining chunks from the __filestream into the leaky pipe
    // TODO:
    // I suppose it's possible this step may need to change later, but only
    // if we want receivers to be able to continue to use the __filestreams after
    // an error occurs (I don't see why we would..)

    // for everything to work.  Otherwise, responses never get sent.

  // (this would involve pausing the flow of incoming part streams
  //  coming from the `on("part")` signals emitted from the MPU request)
  //
  // Easy enough right?
  // -BUT-
  // Here's the challenge- the incoming MPU form closing will cause Skipper
  // to stop listening for new files.  So we must always push __filestreams as soon
  // as they arrive.  Not sure if changing this is even preferable...
